# DoctorFlox
## Introduction
DoctorFlox is a lightweight MVVM library for .NET. It is taking a lot of code and ideas from [MVVM Light Toolkit](http://www.mvvmlight.net/) by Laurant Bugnion because the latter is not maintained anymore. We also took ideas and code from [Prism](https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism) because they told us that WPF is not in their focus anymore (see this [Issue](https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism/issues/1211)).

We polished the source code and got rid of the Silverlight and DotnetFx components. We concentrate on the full .NET Framework currently. Future releases might involve .NET Core components too.
