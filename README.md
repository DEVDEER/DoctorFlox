# DoctorFlox
## Introduction
DoctorFlox is a lightweight MVVM library for .NET. It is taking a lot of code and ideas from [MVVM Light Toolkit](http://www.mvvmlight.net/) by Laurant Bugnion because the latter is not maintained anymore. We also took ideas and code from [Prism](https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism) because they told us that WPF is not in their focus anymore (see this [Issue](https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism/issues/1211)).

We polished the source code and got rid of the Silverlight and DotnetFx components. We concentrate on the full .NET Framework currently. Future releases might involve .NET Core components too.

## DoctorFlox?

We are a bunch of Geeks and so Star Trek is kind of a natural source for project names to us. This beeing said we decided to use Dr. Phlox as our inspiration. He is always patient and looks to ordinary humans just like we do some times :-). Anyway! In order to not conflict with some weird search engine issues (you know what we mean) we decided to use a `F` instead of the `Ph`. In fact it doesn't matter in our opinion because package names like `SlowCheetah` worked out very well.

## Installation

DoctorFlox is available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/devdeer.DoctorFlox). Using NuGet tools just type
